    <h1><em>Voting: A Brief History</em></h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>With the biggest and part of the few most controversial presidential election so far in American histroy,
      election year 2020 surely has one of the biggest questions to ask? Who will become the next president of the
      United States? Before we get into that, first we must flip the clock and go back in time to see how exaclty voting
      became one of the biggest key players in U.S history.</p>
</div>

    <h2>From the top: 1700's</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Let's paint the pictue: In the early 1700's the right to vote was genrally limited to those of the caucasin
      ethnic persuasion. Although the U.S constituton left it to the the individual states to determine voter
      eligibility, most states restricted voting to white males who owned property, and in some cases some states also
      conducted test to ensure only christian men could vote. </p>
</div>

    <h2>The 1800's</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>During this time slowly the offical barriers to voting start to recede. Following the Civil War, Congrees passed
      the 15th Amendment which ensured citizens could not be denied the right to vote based off their race; however, to
      counter the 15th Amendment, many states (more commonly in the south) imposed different barricades to voting such
      as: Voter taxes and literacy tests. More so to reduce the number of African American voters.</p>
</div>

    <h2>The 1900's</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>In the early 20th Century, women were still only able to vote in a handful of states. Many organizations and
      activist groups fought a relentless battle which ultimately lead the U.S Constitution being ratified and the 19th
      Amendment was passed nation wide to give women the right to vote. Although the battle was far from over, around
      the 1960's, southern states began to ramp up barriers to inpeed on voting rights such as: literacy tests, poll
      taxes, language requirments and more. Aimed at surpressing the right to vote among people of color, imigrants, and
      low-income populations. In the late 60's, early 70's Congress passes the Voting Rights Act which rid of most state
      imposed barriers for voting and would later go onto establish the 26th Amendment which prohibits both the state
      and federal government from using age as a reason to deny a citizen that is at least 18 years old. </p>

    <p>During the mid 1970's and early 1980's, the Voting Rights Act was given new provisions by Congress that protected
      citizens of the language minority groups by providing voting material in other languages. Eventually Congress
      required voting protection for people with disabilities. </p>
</div>

    <h2> Modern Times:</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>In todays world it's as easy to register to vote with a few clicks of your mouse and few strokes of your
      keyboard. Todays' voting issues stem from citizens wondering how they'll vote amist the COVID-19 Global Pandemic.
      Surely it may not be as important as facing social issues to help American citizens of different demographics to
      vote as it was back in the 1900's; however, election year 2020 will be one that is unique within our history
      books. </p>
